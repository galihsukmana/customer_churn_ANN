# Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Welcome to the repository for my Customer Churn Prediction project using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow! This project focuses on building and training a deep learning model to predict customer churn in a business setting. By utilizing an ANN, we aim to identify customers who are likely to churn, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Introduction
In this project, I developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict customer churn, which refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue their business relationship with a company. By analyzing various customer-related features, such as demographics, transaction history, and engagement metrics, the model can identify patterns indicative of churn risk.

The ANN model was implemented using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. By leveraging its capabilities, I trained the model on a labeled dataset to learn complex relationships between the input features and the churn outcome. The goal of this project is to assist businesses in understanding and addressing customer churn by predicting potential churners.

## Dataset
The churn prediction model was trained on a labeled dataset called churn.csv. The dataset comprises a range of customer attributes, including demographic information, transaction history, customer engagement metrics, and the churn label indicating whether a customer has churned or not. To access the dataset and reproduce the experiments, please follow the instructions provided in this repository 

## Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:galihsukmana/customer_churn_ANN.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To use the trained ANN model for predicting customer churn, follow these steps:
1. Load the pre-trained model weights
2. Preprocess the input data
3. Make churn predictions using the model


## Results
The ANN model achieved classification report, such as accuracy, precision and recall on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting customer churn. By leveraging the predictive power of the model, businesses can proactively identify customers at risk of churn and implement targeted retention strategies to mitigate churn rates. This has a 85% f1 score for prediction.
